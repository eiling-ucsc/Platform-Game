**Platform Game**

A rudimentary platform game made by me. 
Requirements:
- Player avatar movement. The player must be able to move horizontally, and must be capable of at least single jumping.
- Ground and platforms. The game level must have at least one ground and one platform type of tile and associated behavior.
- Collectible items. The game level must have at least one kind of collectible item.
- End of level condition. There must be some way for the player to complete a level. 
- Level size. The level must be roughly three screen widths wide (that is, a fair bit wider than it is tall, hence requiring some amount of camera scrolling to access the initially hidden elements of the level). So long as the level involves horizontal scrolling to access initially hidden elements, you will receive full credit here.
- Scrolling & camera. The game must scroll the gameworld as the player moves through it, and must have a designed camera behavior.
- Particle Juice. The game must use a particle system to communicate horizontal player avatar movement, and another particle system to communicate vertical (jumping) player avatar movement. The horizontal movement particle system needs to look different from the system provided in S7: Platformers ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ú® + üì∑, such as by changing the number of particles emitted (fewer would be better), changing the texture used (pick another set from the tile sheet provided), changing the emission rate, and others. Look at other platformer games for ideas on how to make these particles look better (the movement particle system used in the section assignment could definitely look better!).
- Audio juice. The game must use audio effects to help communicate at least one of the following actions: jumping, moving, landing, or collecting the collectibles.
